# WorkLifeBalance

Before the pandemic, remote work was largely intentional, and people who chose it generally did so knowing it would fit well into their lives. Maybe they already had home offices organized and set up in quiet spaces with limited distractions, child care lined up for their children, and older kids safely accounted for at school. After all, when you choose a job that allows you to work from home, you can build remote work around the rest of your life—and vice versa.

However, that wasn’t the case for the millions of people working remotely for the first time due to the coronavirus. For them, setting up the perfect work-from-home scenario just wasn’t an option.

Even workers who were used to remote work suddenly had to contend with all kinds of new circumstances. Whether it was kids home from school (who either needed help with online classes or just to be kept occupied), partners also working from home, or the loss of everyday routines, people everywhere have had to figure out how to navigate the new realities of work.

Add to that the potential isolation of not physically seeing coworkers, friends, and family—along with the flurry of current events—and anxiety and stress can build up before you know it.

# Mental Health and Remote Work
In one survey, 60% of employees report an improved work-life balance during the pandemic. But, despite enjoying extra time with family and not having to deal with commuting and other downsides of in-office work, some people are feeling the burn when it comes to working from home during the pandemic.

# 8 Steps for Achieving Work-Life Balance and Productivity

1. Create a Schedule and Set Boundaries
2. Give Yourself Breaks
3. Recreate the Watercooler - Schedule 10 minutes per day to chat with coworkers (via Slack, Zoom, or any other real-time communication tool) about non-work stuff.
4. Get Fresh Air
5. Make Time for Yourself
6. Take Time Off
7. Keep News to a Minimum - It’s good to stay informed on the current state of things, but try not to make each of your daily “inputs” a news update. Continuous exposure to negative news can elevate your stress and anxiety, and take your mind out of the game when you try to focus on your job.
9. Ask for Support - There may be times when taking breaks and having the best laid plans to take care of yourself are still not enough. It’s normal to be nervous about the state of things right now—like your family, your health, and the economy. Just remember that your mental health is important, too.  Don’t be afraid to reach out to a family member, friend, colleague, human resources team, or an Employee Assistance Plan (EAP) for support and resources.
